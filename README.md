# liquidex's treehouse

Welcome to the Construct.

If you haven't seen the treehouse yet, you [may wanna](https://liquidex.house). It's pretty darn cool.

Please note that this repository contains spoilers. So if you like exploring by yourself, you may wanna do that first before diving into the source code.

*Spoilers for what?*, you might ask.

â€¦

You have been warned.

## Building

The following commands require [`just`](https://github.com/casey/just).
Running a development server requires [`cargo-watch`](https://github.com/watchexec/cargo-watch).

To serve the website on `http://localhost:8080` for development:

```sh
just
```

This will start a server on port 8080. You can change the port by using the variable `port`:

```sh
just port=8081
```

The website will reload itself automatically if you change any file in the repository.

## Issues

Please report issues [directly to me](https://liquidex.house/b?hello).
Known issues are tracked on the [treehouse's issue tracker](https://liquidex.house/treehouse/issues).

I do not accept and do not plan to accept external contributions to the treehouse's codebase, because then it would no longer be *my* treehouse.
