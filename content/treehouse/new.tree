- a while back I was casually exploring the Unreal Engine codebase at work, and thought to myself that

### systems are just a bunch of code

now released. from the backburner. I can't believe I forgot to add an entry about it to the [programming blog branch][branch:01HPD4XQQ5GPQ20C6BPA8G670F].

- it's updatin' time! I took some time to clean up old pages and update my *about me*.\
over time I've been learning how to write content on the treehouse effectively, and the new about me reflects that.

- I started a branch on user interface and user experience design, because I was working with mintty at work and had some thoughts about it.
