- [featured]{.badge .blue} I was bored over a weekend, so I decided to write the tiniest programming language I could imagine.
it came out looking pretty Lispy, and I'm glad about that!
I learned a ton about Lisps in the process of researching it.
even though it didn't end up having macros...

- I decided to write up some ideas on what sort of cool data analysis I could do on my [ListenBrainz data set][def:social/listenbrainz].
I haven't done any of it yet, but I thought it'd be cool to share my ideas anyways!

- sometimes people call me crazy for saying that bashing JavaScript is senseless and that it's not as bad of a language as people make it out to be.
so I decided to collect my thoughts into a nice little page I can link easily.

- a friend of mine asked if it makes sense to define your own wrapper class for `SDL_Window` the way [Lazy Foo](https://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/10_color_keying/index.php) does it.
I told him there's no reason to do that in modern C++, because `std::unique_ptr` can do everything for you anyways.

### freeing C memory automatically using `std::unique_ptr` and `std::shared_ptr`

~on another note, I did read a blog post about this once somewhere, but couldn't be bothered to find it. so there you go! I made a post about this too.~

- it's updatin' time! I took some time to clean up old pages and update my _about me_.\
over time I've been learning how to write content on the treehouse effectively, and the new about me reflects that.

- I recently got a question from my someone telling me they doesn't understand why `*x` does not read from the pointer `x` when on the left-hand side of an assignment.
and that made me think,

### what's up with `*x` not always meaning the same thing in different contexts?

- I've been thinking recently how cool it is to be able to single-step into Unreal Engine's source code and edit it while you're working with it, and how uncool it is that I can't do the same thing easily in the Rust world.

after all, aren't we just dealing with a bunch of code running on the computer? why not let me poke at it?
