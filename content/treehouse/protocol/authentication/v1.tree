- ### Description

    - Certain operations require authorization as a verified :verified: person.

    - These operations usually involve messing with parts of the treehouse, such as opening doors.

- ### Progress cookies

    + Authenticating in the treehouse requires cookies.
    By creating an account, you agree that the treehouse will store a *progress cookie* in your browser.

        - Since maintaining a real account system is expensive, your progress and interactions with characters will be stored in a local cookie.

        + This *does* mean you can skip parts of the story if you get someone else's progress cookie, or reverse engineer the format, but doing that is not recommended.

            - The website is built on the assumption you have interacted with everything in a natural way, so things may break if you replace your cookie with someone else's.

        - Note that the cookie does not contain any personally identifiable information.
        However, participating in the story will mean you'll have to **unblock cookies** for the treehouse.
        If that doesn't sit right with you, you'll have to miss out on it.

- ### Creating an account

    - Tune into `/radio/station/1094927188` to create an account.

+ ### Resetting progress

    - The intention is that all your progress in the treehouse is **permanent.**
    It is possible to reset your progress by erasing browser data for the website, but it goes against the intended experience and is not recommended.
