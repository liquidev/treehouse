- ### Description

    % id = "01HZ5BE84Y957FSBEVH5CKT3MX"
    - Certain operations require authorization as a **verified** :verified: person.

    % id = "01HZ5BE84Y3FA817ZXMDTYJ62T"
    - These operations usually involve messing with parts of the treehouse, such as opening doors.

- ### Progress cookies

    % id = "01HZ5BE84YW0P14PZN8M3HF2FW"
    + Authenticating in the treehouse requires cookies.
    By creating an account, you agree that the treehouse will store a *progress cookie* in your browser.

        % id = "01HZ5BE84Y22X1PNVQ31YMJ9M3"
        - Since maintaining a real account system is expensive, your progress and interactions with characters will be stored **fully locally**.

        % id = "01HZ5BE84Y36V9HCHJBRBRDAF5"
        + This *does* mean you can skip parts of the story if you get someone else's progress cookie, or reverse engineer the format, but doing that is not recommended.

            % id = "01HZ5BE84Y2TFY1A6HQ732AN7S"
            - The website is built on the assumption you have interacted with everything in a natural way, so things may break if you replace your cookie with someone else's.

        % id = "01HZ5BE84YMYTTF2HGGSSE6YYK"
        - Note that the cookie does not contain any personally identifiable information.
        However, participating in the story will mean you'll have to **unblock cookies** for the treehouse.
        If that doesn't sit right with you, you'll have to miss out on it.

- ### Creating an account

    % id = "01HZ5BE84YDZV3RRHEJAXXHKP1"
    - Tune into `/radio/station/1094927188` to create an account.

% id = "01HZ5BE84Y78YZ8GKMR105M4E3"
+ ### Resetting progress

    % id = "01HZ5BE84YE8F2NA1GDE45S8GE"
    - The intention is that all your progress in the treehouse is **permanent.**
    It is possible to reset your progress by erasing browser data for the website, but it goes against the intended experience and is not recommended.
