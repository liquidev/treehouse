    % id = "01HPWEESFVY5WGP5NY94QXFQ2A"
    - I watched this anime recently and I really liked the soundtrack, so I thought to myself "cool, gotta buy it and enjoy it in glorious FLAC while I'm driving my ~~taxi~~ car"

    % id = "01HPWEESFV1W7Y0713F5P74EPQ"
    - naturally I was absolutely unprepared for the shitshow that is purchasing music from Japan

    % id = "01HPWEESFVC3ZX091BN3ZFT4YB"
    - for some reason some business pinheads thought it would be an *incredible and wise idea* to introduce *region locks* to music!

        % id = "01HPWEESFV2AF3V1GMFZYKECHF"
        - fuck the fact that you can legitimately buy this album as a pack of FLAC files in Japan, if you're anywhere else - eat shit!

    ### that's right, it's all gone!

    % id = "01HPECQ3Z1G88WVAVREGBCDEZ0"
    - now I know that [Benn is an avid hater](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXudOLStaXA) [of streaming platforms himself](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDfNRWsMRsU), but something didn't smell right.
